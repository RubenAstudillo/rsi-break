# RSI-break

Quick pomodoro style timer so you hands get a rest interval.

## Health advice

This is a tool but not a cure. Physical therapy with an specialist can give
you a window of time where you are free of pain. Then exercise is the long
term solution. I am following this path, ask me in 3 years if it worked :-)
.

## This is GUI programming

It should be pretty self explanatory on how to use. If you have `mpv`
installed on your PATH you will also get a _ding_ sound when the timer goes
off.
